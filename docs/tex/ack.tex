\section*{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank Dr. Idit Keidar for the important suggestions
about the quorum system. In fact, the idea of separating the KV quorum
system from the auth quorum system appears in her email messages. Also
Dr. Edward Bortnikov and Prof. Juan A. Garay helped us move the
project forward.
