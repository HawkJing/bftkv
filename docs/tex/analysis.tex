\section{Security Analysis}
We look into attacks against the fundamental property:
$READ(Q_1,x) = READ(Q_2,x)$ for $\forall Q_1, Q_2 \in QS$, which is
known as equivocation.  The best that attackers can do is divide a
clique into two sets and ask each set to sign $\langle x,t,v \rangle$
and $\langle x,t,v' \rangle$ separately. Then do the {\em write}
protocol for the target nodes with collected signature sets $S$ and
$S'$. Honest servers will refuse the request because it does not
satisfy the basic $b$-masking quorum condition: $|S| \geq b+1$. But
with $b+1$ colluding nodes, the attack will succeed.

\foreach \p/\t/\l in {25//,40/$\mathcal{H}_1$/Honest nodes,
20/$\mathcal{F}$/Faulty nodes, 40/$\mathcal{H}_2$/Honest nodes}

    \setcounter{a}{\value{b}}
    \addtocounter{b}{\p}
    \slice{\thea/100*360}
          {\theb/100*360}
          {\t}{\l}
  }

\end{tikzpicture}


The maximum number of signatures dishonest clients can get is
$b+(n-b)/2$. Therefore, to overcome the attack we need
\[ n-b > b+(n-b)/2 \Rightarrow n > 3b \]

\subsubsection*{Detecting equivocation on read}
Even if the number of faulty nodes exceeds the above threshold, the
system can detect malicious actions with the following probability
\begin{align*}
  F_p &= Pr[Q \cap \mathcal{H}_1 \neq \emptyset \wedge Q \cap
        \mathcal{H}_2 \neq \emptyset] \\
      & = 1 - Pr[Q \subseteq \mathcal{F} \cup \mathcal{H}_1] \\
      & = 1 - ((n + f) / 2n)^{|Q|}
\end{align*}
when $f > b$ and $|Q| < (f + n)/2$, where $f = |\mathcal{F}|$ is the
number of the faulty nodes, assuming the sizes of $\mathcal{H}_1$ and
$\mathcal{H}_2$ are the same.

In the case of $f \le b$ the detection rate is always 100\% because it is
guaranteed that clients can always find a valid value and anything
other than that is the result of malicious actions. When the number of
faulty nodes exceeds the threshold, i.e., $f > b$, it will be possible that
the client cannot detect all malicious actions. Since the minimum
quorum size is $(n-1)/3$ it does not need to consider the case where
$|Q| < n/3$. Also, if the size exceeds $(f+n)/2$ any quorum always
includes at least one node from each $\mathcal{H}_i$ which makes the
detection rate 100\%.

For example, assume we choose a quorum $|Q| = 3b+1$ out of $n = 4b+1$,
which is the default setup of the kv quorum system, the detection rate
is 100\% up to $f = 2b$ failure nodes.
