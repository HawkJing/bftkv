  Most distributed key-value stores are tolerant to only benign failure,
  which makes it difficult to run it on the public Internet and needs
  additional security measures to protect data integrity from malicious
  attacks. We developed a key-value store that is tolerant to Byzantine
  faults, keeping it in mind to run the system over the public
  Internet. While data integrity is secured on the store, all
  transactions are transparent to anyone.
  The system provides not only a secure kv store but also data secrecy
  and distributed signing features by a threshold
  cryptosystem. Integrating encryption and signature schemes with
  Byzantine fault-tolerant key-value store is much more robust than
  using separated KMS and PKI with an ordinary distributed key-value
  store, as it maximizes a benefit of distributed systems which fit
  very well with threshold cryptography. There is no single point of
  failure in the system.
  The system by itself is useful as a secure key-value store, but those
  properties such as Byzantine fault-tolerance, transparency,
  distributed global storage and threshold cryptosystem, can make the
  system an ideal building block of blockchain technologies.
