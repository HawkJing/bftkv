\section*{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank Prof.~Idit Keidar for her expert advices about
the quorum systems. In fact, the idea of separating the KV quorum
system from the auth quorum system first appeared in her email
messages. Also, Dr.~Edward Bortnikov and Prof.~Juan A.~Garay helped us
move the project forward in many ways.
