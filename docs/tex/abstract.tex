  Most distributed key-value stores are tolerant to only benign failure,
  which makes it difficult to run it on the public Internet and needs
  additional security measures to protect data integrity from malicious
  attacks. We developed a key-value store that is tolerant to Byzantine
  faults, keeping it in mind to run the system over the public
  Internet. While data integrity is secured on the store, all
  transactions are transparent to anyone.
  The system provides not only data integrity but also data secrecy by
  strong password authentication, encryption and signature schemes
  based on threshold cryptography. Integrating encryption and
  signature schemes with Byzantine fault-tolerant key-value store is much
  more robust than using separated KMS and PKI with an ordinary
  distributed key-value store, as it maximizes a benefit of distributed
  system which fits very well with threshold cryptography. There is no
  single point of failure in the system.
  The system by itself is useful as a secure key-value store, but those
  properties such as Byzantine fault-tolerance, transparency,
  distributed global storage and threshold cryptosystem, can make the
  system a building block of blockchain technologies.
