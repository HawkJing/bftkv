\section*{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank Idit Keidar for the important suggestions
about the quorum system. In fact, the idea of separating the KV quorum
system from the auth quorum system first appears in her email
messages. Also Edward Bortnikov and Juan A. Garay helped us move the
project forward in many ways.
